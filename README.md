This repo is for my final in CSC256. The index is the main hub of the site, allowing access to all of the games and the viewing gallery. When clicking on one of the games, the page for said game will open up
as well as a navbar leading to all the other games as well as the home page. At the bottom of each page is also footer that has the link to the about me page. Every page, except for the about me, has their own
js and css file to allow for easier viewing. Lastly, the chess game is very buggy and not fully flushed out due to the complex rules of chess. It's a work in progress but has the basic components of what 
it could be.
